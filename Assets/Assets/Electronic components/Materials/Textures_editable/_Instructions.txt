If you have Photoshop CC2017 or better,you can easily change nominals of some electronics components.

Box_albedo_Custom.psd:
-Here you can draw/put your own emblem in frame area and change the existing texts.
After you've done,save the document,select "EC_Box" material (Electronic components/Materials) and replace his albedo texture with new one which you just saved (Electronic components/Materials/Textures_editable/Box_albedo_Custom).

Capacitors_albedo.psd:
-Here you can change text of capacitors nominal.
After you've done,save the document,select "EC_Capacitors" material (Electronic components/Materials) and replace his albedo texture with new one which you just saved (Electronic components/Materials/Textures_editable/Capacitors_Albedo).
Warning!Because this asset uses specular workflow,for ionistor (gold capacitor) you need to also duplicate his text from albedo to specular map(Electronic components/Materials/Textures_editable/Capacitors_Specular) and also replace specular map into material(Electronic components/Materials/EC_Capacitors).

Diodes_albedo.psd:
-Here you can change text of diode shottky nominal.
After you've done,save the document,select "EC_Diodes" material (Electronic components/Materials) and replace his albedo texture with new one which you just saved (Electronic components/Materials/Textures_editable/Diodes_Albedo).

Transistors_albedo.psd:
-Here you can change text of transistors nominals.
After you've done,save the document,select "EC_Transistors" material (Electronic components/Materials) and replace his albedo texture with new one which you just saved (Electronic components/Materials/Textures_editable/Transistors_Albedo).

Resistors_detail_marking.psd:
-Here you can change marking-nominal colors of resistors.
You can see six color-layers which represents six line on the resistor(frome left(1) to right(6)).Just make double-click on the layer and you will see color box,choose the color whatever you want and that's it!
After you've done,save the document(into photoshop) and your marks will be updated on your resistors(because this map already aplied on all resistor materials,into "Detail albedo x2" slot).
